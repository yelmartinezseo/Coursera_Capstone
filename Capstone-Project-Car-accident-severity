Despite the many measures and campaigns that are deployed each year to raise awareness of the seriousness of the problem, it continues to occur quite frequently. The impact that traffic accidents have on society and the economy is high, with human losses being compounded by heavy expenditures on health care, awareness campaigns, mobilization of specialized personnel, etc.\nThe OMS sets the economic impact of road accidents in a developed country around 2 to 3% of GDP, a significant figure for any country. Working together to reduce this loss has become a major issue of general concern."
